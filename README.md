# 1st-Python-Project-
A Python-based voice assistant that listens to commands, recognizes speech, gives spoken replies, tells time, fetches weather, and opens websites using simple automation. It demonstrates basic Python modules.
 # Voice Assistant (Python)
* Project Overview:-

This is a simple, yet fun, Voice Assistant built entirely in Python. It allows you to interact with your computer using natural voice commands for common tasks like checking the time, getting the weather, and opening popular websites.
The goal of this project was to explore the capabilities of Python libraries like speech_recognition and pyttsx3 to create a basic but functional utility, and it serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in building their own voice-activated applications.

# Features
The assistant currently supports the following commands:

*Time & Date: Tell me the current time or date.
*Web Navigation: Opens Google or YouTube in your default web browser.
*Weather Check: Provides a quick weather summary for any specified city using the wttr.in service.
*Basic Conversation: Responds to "Hello" and "Who are you".
*Exit: Stops the assistant when you say "Stop," "Bye," or "Exit."

#Installation & Setup
To get this voice assistant running on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install Dependencies
This project relies on a few key Python libraries. You can install all of them using pip:
Bash

pip install SpeechRecognition 
pip install pyttsx3 
pip install PyAudio 
pip install requests

3. Run the Assistant
Save the code provided above as a Python file (e.g., assistant.py).
Run it from your terminal:
Bash:- python assistant.py
The assistant will greet you, and you should see "Listening..." printed, indicating it's ready for your command.
# How to Use
*The assistant starts and greets you.
*When you see "Listening..." in the console, speak a command clearly into your microphone.
*The assistant will print "You said: [Your command]" and respond accordingly.
