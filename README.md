 🗣️ Voice Assistant (Python)
✨ Project Overview
This is a simple, yet fun, Voice Assistant built entirely in Python. It allows you to interact with your computer using natural voice commands for common tasks like checking the time, getting the weather, and opening popular websites.

The goal of this project was to explore the capabilities of Python libraries like speech_recognition and pyttsx3 to create a basic but functional utility, and it serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in building their own voice-activated applications.
🚀 Features
The assistant currently supports the following commands:

Time & Date: Tell me the current time or date.

Web Navigation: Opens Google or YouTube in your default web browser.

Weather Check: Provides a quick weather summary for any specified city using the wttr.in service.

Basic Conversation: Responds to "Hello" and "Who are you".

Exit: Stops the assistant when you say "Stop," "Bye," or "Exit."
